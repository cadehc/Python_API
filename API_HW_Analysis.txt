## Part 1 Analysis

We can see on the temperature vs latitude graph that the temperature increases as latitude approaches zero, nearing the equator.
We also see that temperature drop dramatically as we get to postive 60+ latitude, which is approaching the North Pole.
The temperature graph in general, has an upside-down parabolic shape as each end of the x-axis signifies low temperatures.


In the humidity vs latitude plot, we see that temperature has a much higher influence on humidity than latitude does, 
likely because the highest density of points are on the equator at 0 longitude. However, it's safe to say that high humidity 
is common in most areas, especially in hot and possibly coastal/rainforest climates around the equator. When comparing hemispheres,
we see that humidity seems to be much more common in the northern hemisphere and at a wider percentage range. Humidity in the southern
hemisphere is less evenly distributed.


When looking at the cloudiness vs latitude plot we see that, for the most part, the data is distributed pretty evenly. However, there
are a couple areas on the plot that stand out: on the equator at 100 percent cloudiness (likely rainforest climates and storms moving 
across the Atlantic Ocean), and in positive latitude (20-40) at 0 percent cloudiness (likely because of areas that have moderate 
temperatures and generally many sunny days in a given year).
